# Twitch-Plays-Control-My-PC

An overhaul update to DougDoug TwitchPlays script.

**this script is meant for twitch.tv/controlmypc / https://cmpc.cf and its developers, you must have authentication from the development team, or cmpc to run this script.**


# NOTICE: Any forks of this repo MUST be private. thank you.

# Installation:

  1) In order to run you must download python 3.xx (Will suggest latest version from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/).

  2) After downloading open a cmd and run these commands:
  
  • python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  
  • pip install pyautogui
  
  • pip install pydirectinput
  
  • pip install forever

  3)Edit TwitchPlays_AccountInfo.py with the username and oauth: (You can find your oauth from the link provided inside the file or just click this http://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

  4)Run start.bat (And hope it doesn't crash cause it can't send data or can't authenticate account.)
