(This is a fork of https://gitlab.com/cmpcsg/TwitchPlays. The history of the repo is still here, although every profile link has been replaced by the github URL.)
(This is basically their stuff but with some commands deleted.)
(I will not support any installation, and I put it as a Github repo only for practical use.)

# TwitchPlays

The script that allows controlling of ~~a pc~~ Undertale remotely through a Twitch chat. Started as an overhaul update to DougDoug TwitchPlays script.


# NOTICE: Under the license, you must disclose the source of this code in all usages. 

# Installation:

  (Note: It is recommended that you know how to use the Terminal of your OS and that you have basic knowledge of the Git CLI.)

  1) In order to run you must download a 3.X.X version of Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/). The script is normally run on python version `3.8` - `3.9`. The current recommended python version [runtime.txt](https://gitlab.com/controlmypc/TwitchPlays/-/blob/main/runtime.txt) using the [heroku style](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-runtimes).

  2) To install you can either do one of 2 things.
  - Clone using Git
  - Download the Zip file

  3) After downloading open a terminal of your choice, and run these commands to install the script's dependencies (using a [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) or other virtual environment can be a good idea)::

  * `python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel`
  * `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

  4)  Create `config/config.toml` based on `config/config.example.toml` with your Twitch username, oauth key, and other info and settings. (you can generate a blank config.toml with `config/create_empty_config.py` and get a Twitch oauth token with `new_oauth_key.py`).

  5) Run `TwitchPlays.py` using `python TwitchPlays.py` - You can do this as a command on most environments as `TwitchPlays`.

## "I don't have all this fancy stuff (Discord webhooks, API for moderator lists, etc.), what can I do?"

- No API ) If you don't have a Webserver or CDN hosting your config, you can modify `TwitchPlays.py (Line 137)` to use a static user list. Leaving out config values is a wanted feature and may be added in the future

Example static user list.
```
{
  "devlist" : [
    "developers here"
  ],
  "modlist" : [
    "moderators here"
  ]
}

```

- No Webhooks: If you don't know how to make a discord webhook, there are plenty of guides online. Without a webhook most commands do absolutely nothing. If you would like to send webhooks to a different service (I.E: Slack), you can modify some of the webhook code (`./cmpc/utils.py` handles most webhooks.). You can use 1 webhook for the entire script, but it is not recommended.

# What's New highlight:

Close individual instances if multiple are running by accident, using the new `../script id` and `../script stop <id>` commands.
